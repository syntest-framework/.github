The SynTest Framework is an initiative started at the [CISELab](https://www.ciselab.com/) (part of the [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en)) to bring state-of-the-art search-based software testing techniques to the masses and apply them in practice.

The goal of the framework is to create a platform to improve further scientific research and at the same time provide a user-friendly industry-grade tool.
